# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application designed to help users manage their time more effectively. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

2. **Start the Timer**: Click the 'start' button to begin the timer.
3. **Pause/Reset**: Use the 'pause' button to temporarily stop the timer and the 'reset' button to set the timer back to zero.
