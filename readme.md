# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application designed to help users manage their time more effectively. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Motivation

This project was created by me, for myself. This is my first real project. I created it to improve my knowledge and to use it for studying with the Pomodoro method.

## Features
- **Customizable Timer**: Set your own work duration, break duration, and the number of cycles.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with a clear display of the timer.
- **Start/Pause/Reset**: Control the timer with simple start, pause, and reset buttons.

## How to Use

1. **Set the Timer**: Enter the desired number of minutes for the work session, break duration, and the number of cycles you wish to complete.
2. **Start the Timer**: Click the 'start' button to begin the timer.
3. **Pause/Reset**: Use the 'pause' button to temporarily stop the timer and the 'reset' button to set the timer back to zero.

⚠️ **Note**: To set intervals, the timer needs to be paused.
